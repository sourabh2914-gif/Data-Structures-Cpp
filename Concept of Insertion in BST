🌳 What is a Binary Search Tree (BST)?
  ->A Binary Search Tree is a special kind of binary tree where:
  ->Each node has at most two children
  ->Left subtree contains values less than the node
  ->Right subtree contains values greater than the node
  ->No duplicates (in classic BST)

BST Rule (Golden Rule ✨): Left < Root < Right

🔹Concept of Insertion in BST
    When inserting a new value:
  ->Start from the root
  ->Compare the value with the current node:
      If smaller, go to the left
      If greater, go to the right
  ->Repeat until you find a NULL position
  ->Insert the new node there
📌 Important:
  BST insertion is always done at a leaf position

🧠 Example

Insert values: 50, 30, 70, 20, 40
        50
       /  \
     30    70
    /  \
  20   40
