🌳 What is a Red-Black Tree?
  ->A Red-Black Tree (RBT) is a self-balancing Binary Search Tree that guarantees O(log n) time for insert, delete, and search.

🔴⚫ Red-Black Tree Properties (MUST KNOW)

  ->Every node is either RED or BLACK
  ->Root is always BLACK
  ->All leaves (NULL) are BLACK
  ->No two consecutive RED nodes
  ->Every path from a node to its descendant NULL nodes has the same number of BLACK nodes

🧠 Insertion Concept (High Level)

Insertion happens in two steps:
  Step 1️⃣ BST Insert
    ->Insert the node like a normal BST
    ->New node is always RED
  Step 2️⃣ Fix Violations
    ->If parent is BLACK → ✅ no problem
    ->If parent is RED → ❌ violation → fix using:
                        *Recoloring
                        *Rotations (Left / Right)
